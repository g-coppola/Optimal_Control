# Optimal_Control (LQR and Model Predictive Control)
This Repository contains algorithms of **Optimal Control** applied to a real model (Ball and Beam).

## 🎯 Objective of the Project
The objective of this project is to build a control law $u(t)$ which minimize the cost function $J$ subject to some input and state constraints
